As a researcher at [rinna Co., Ltd.](https://rinna.co.jp/), I am deeply passionate about advancing the boundaries of human-AI interaction.
My primary focus lies in developing innovative systems for speech synthesis and spoken dialogue modeling, aiming to create more natural and fluid conversations with AI. 
Recently, my interests have expanded to include the fascinating realms of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and the potential of collective intelligence.
